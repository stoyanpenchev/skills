#   +4  `loc` · Conf   +4  <!--/F-->
#   +5
#   +6  body …
#
# Read with the finding geometry, a lead put its WHOLE formatted line in `title` (which the
# emitter then wrapped in `- **…**` a second time), found no backticks at +4 so `loc` came out
# empty, and had no body region at all. Each kind now gets its own reader.
#
# **No field is ever emitted empty** — `-` stands in. `read` below splits on IFS=$'\t', and a
# tab is IFS *whitespace*, so bash collapses `\t\t` into one delimiter and every later field
# shifts left by one. That is how a lead's memory tag ended up printed as its location.
